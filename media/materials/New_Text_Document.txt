00:00:04	Special Operations covert Ops espionage the team house with your hopes Jack Murphy and David Park [Applause] all right guys take three episode 189 I'm Jack Dave see over here D's back there uh Ismail ish viegas is our guest today uh this is going to be a recorded episode because we have some weather coming through New York and it's killing our internet so adapt and overcome uh ish let's just jump right into it man uh if you could just tell us sort of uh what was your path into the Air Force all right

00:00:51	um thank you for having me um it's an honor uh talking to you guys and being the first combat controller thank you for your patience oh dude no worries I couldn't get my mic started so you know you guys put up with me first um but anyway yeah I I grew up in Mexico uh or I I was born in Mexico City and uh so I spent a lot of time down there um you know even after my parents immigrated to the US I was pretty young but uh I would spend all my Summers down there and I'd always watch uh the soldiers come down from the mountains

00:01:25	and you know they all had guns and you know I I mean I knew they were conventional Army but and my grandfather hosted them all the time so you know I'd hear their stories and whatnot who they were hunting um so that kind of started getting me interested in uh you know kind of military service not obviously not on the Mexico side but uh having come to America and you know having lived extremely poor when we were in Mexico and having the opportunity you know it's it's it was something that I wanted to do for my

00:02:01	country um I wanted to do a service because even growing up poor here in America like I mean you you truly don't know how great this country is you know unless you've actually lived in a third world country you know and I had that experience I knew what I had and uh I knew how blessed I was so I wanted to give something back you know and my entire uh growing up my entire childhood I knew that I wanted to join the military I wanted to do special ops uh specifically um I grew up watching you know shows

00:02:37	like tour Duty and you know Charlie Sheen's Navy Seals and all that stuff like you know just badass movies and and so that's something that always piqued my interest and so when I first started looking during High School um I kind of started looking at the Navy I started looking at the Army and you know the Marine Corps like you know take three the Marine Corps it never really interested me you know my buddies kept coming back and said hey man you you know you don't want to do it just go a different route and I was like all

00:03:12	right you know so uh I want to talk to the Navy recruiter and they weren't taking guys right out of basic training you know my thought process was like I don't want to be on a boat for two years that's all I knew about the Navy it was a boat you know and the Army didn't have the X-ray program at the time and I was like man I don't want to go into the regular army and you know who knows what's going to happen then so I was pretty bummed out I was depressed and you know I just walked out of his office and I got greeted by

00:03:45	the air force uh recruiter next door down and he looked at me and he's like hey man but you know what's up you know you look you look a little bummed I'm like yeah man I I am you know it's like I uh I wanted to join these services and here's why and he's like well hey have you thought about joining the Air Force and I'm like man you guys have nothing for me you know at the time I had no idea that they were there of course actually had you know a couple soft units PJ and CCT and you know PJ's read a lot of books so

00:04:15	everybody knows about PJs um and they were great you know Vietnam uh they were instrumental saving lives all the time um so he brings me in and he's like yeah man um here's a pamphlet kind of they didn't know much about the job at the time and he's like yeah these guys you know they get to work with the seals they get to work with the Green Berets they get to work with all kinds of soft forces and you know you get all the cool toys that these guys do and you get you know you shoot move and communicate and I'm like

00:04:46	awesome I'm like my first question was um can you join right out of basic training and he said yeah absolutely you know so I signed up six months prior um I was finishing up summer school so I graduate on time and I came in shortly thereafter um I enlisted before you know the delayed the delayed entry program and I came into basic training August 6 1997. and uh that was my path into the air force so what was uh the pipeline like uh to become a CCT uh obviously it was a it was a hell of a lot different back then and uh I want to

00:05:28	say they they dimed it uh the new breed um and that's basically because combat control joined uh in to the pararescue pipeline so it was PJs and controllers going through together and you know at the time it was kind of a sheer luck I signed a contract for combat control and you know they lined us up and it just so happened that um I was chosen as a combat controller and I don't know how the Cadre did it back then because like you look like a controller you're gonna be a controller I'm like all right sounds good that's

00:06:00	what I wanted anyway you know and so very very different it was 10 weeks um and it was basically just a kick in the balls uh from morning to evening um it was you spent your first half of the day uh pretty much getting your you know your balls kicked in uh a lot of push-ups a lot of pull-ups a lot of running um and then the other half of your day was spent in the pool so you know getting basically to the point of exhaustion every single day and the pool was always a great equalizer um it didn't matter how strong you were it

00:06:40	didn't matter how fast you were once everybody got in that pool everybody was on the same playing field you know and uh that's the place where grown men cry so and ultimately that's what those guys in is the pool what what was it about the power rescue CCT selection phase why did they focus on the pool so much because you associate that with seals and then later with like Special Forces pre-scuba and things like that but why was it so focused on on these Air Force assets you know I think it's because uh

00:07:15	obviously we we are Air Force so when you think of Air Force you think of you know these guys that work behind a desk um you know you don't really think a soft when you when you look at the Air Force and you know the PJs have had that selection for a while but um I've never actually inquired about it but you know I think the thought process behind it is we are going to work with the seals and we are going to work with the Green Berets and we have to have that ability we have to have that same mental fortitude that

00:07:48	these guys have if we're going to be successful so you know it's kind of the thought process where we have to do our job and we also have to be able to do you know the same things that are soft Brethren can do as well so um and it's a huge gut check as well you know it it if you can't handle the pool um you're probably looking for a different job because uh the pool is the place where it either makes you or it breaks you know I was just going to ask for anybody listening to this who's thinking about

00:08:24	going in for a PGA or CCT you know a young adult who's looking at those as career fields what how do they get ready for something like that because you obviously didn't it doesn't sound like you were you spent a long time preparing for that prior to going in no man I I actually did very little preparation um you know I joined the gym uh I started swimming at that in the lake of all places you know which is not the place to start so if you're listening don't do what I did you know say uh do safe swimming in a pool let the

00:09:04	Lifeguard know what you're trying to do um they usually get you they they let you get away with a little bit more um but I had no idea you know I was 130 pounds soaking wet and I actually think I was 128 pounds coming in you know I had no idea how to work out I had no idea uh the physical fitness you know what level of conditioning your body actually has to be in um it's changed a little bit but the concept is very still very much the same it's all about endurance um and it really is pushing your body to

00:09:40	whatever the past test is at the time but you still keep pushing it you're like when I used to do the recruiting job I teach guys like man pass the past test and you should be able to take it at least two more times and still pass it you know um once you know you can pass the past test like start working your body Beyond its limits and you know yeah it's a lot of calisthenics but at the same time you know it's uh you have to condition your body all around so you have to be well-rounded you know it's not just legs

00:10:16	it's not just chest you know and um you have to have the speed you have to have the power you have to have the endurance um and start surpassing those limits that are set by the past test um and but now that I'm sorry go ahead no I was just saying what about the mental aspect because you went in not well prepped 128 pounds maybe 130 if we're gonna you know give you the benefit of Doubt um and you saw guys quit all around you I imagine you had a high you know a high attrition rate in your class what was it

00:10:50	about you mentally going through that course that set you apart from other people you know that that's one of the things that we that I wish we had a magic formula for because I couldn't tell you how I you know how to I can't tell you what guy's gonna make it I can't tell you what guy's gonna fail you know I like I have seen Olympians guys that I could not physically smoke just phenomenal athletes and for whatever reason they end up quitting and you know and then I've also seen on the other spectrum is guys that you know

00:11:31	like myself who haven't worked out a lot um are hurting the entire way we're lagging behind but they don't quit you know and I think it's heart is one of the one of the biggest indicators like kids who have heart like I mean I'm telling you they it's something about them that they just continue to go like me and myself you know when I was going through yeah I thought about quitting every day uh but my thought process at the time was like I am not going to quit um they're gonna have to take me out of

00:12:07	here in a body bag you know or whatever the case but or if they're gonna have to force me equip but I'm not I'm not quitting um you know for me I used my mother a lot uh every time I felt sorry for myself every time I you know I was like man I can make the pain go away as I thought about my mother you know obviously she brought us to America and we were extremely poor and I was like man I'm doing it for her I'm doing it because you know the trials and tribulations that she went through getting us here you know the the

00:12:37	sacrifices that she made uh housing is feeding us you know working and in the back of my mind I wasn't gonna give up because I wasn't gonna let her down you know and I I think it's just digging really deep and having that mental fortitude and you know like I said it's hard to determine who actually has it but it's like you have to have that mindset of like I will make it you know and let them eliminate you don't get it in your head that you're gonna quit because as soon as you start thinking it it just makes it easier and

00:13:14	easier to basically just want to give up you know what was the next step in the pipeline after selection so once you uh we graduated selection uh which is basically preparing us for dive school um at the time it was uh the Army dive school special forces underwater operations um so Key West which I mean that in and of itself was one of the biggest gut checks you know beyond our selection I mean it was it was the selection and I mean it really humbled you and uh so you everyone had to make it through dive school I imagine they front

00:13:58	loaded it for that reason because it was so difficult uh to see who could you know make it through that next phase that next check and uh and then what what was after dive School um it uh it all kind of varied uh depending on uh the schedule you know we had uh uh the uh the dunker the helicopter rolls you over in the pool and you gotta Escape it um and then after that was uh staticline school and then uh Halo School shortly after that um then we went out to uh air traffic and throw school because we are also a

00:14:34	certified air traffic controllers you know and that's ATC is what is our primary emission set um it is what we started as you know we jump in with the Rangers we set up the airfields uh we bring in the the aircraft helo's uh fixed swing and all the follow-on forces and then we jump in with uh whatever forces are coming in and we go out and work and you know start doing the closer support business how how long is air traffic control School air traffic controls goes about three months long um but it's it you know it's a different

00:15:13	kind of hard in and of itself because you know ATC you're basically learning a different language um and it's very intense too because now you got aircraft you know in the sky so it's like the last thing you want is you know metal on metal because you can't separate you know the two so I mean it's a it's a pretty intense it's mentally intense I mean it's still physically intense because you're still having to maintain your physical fitness you're still getting uh Smoked by the instructors um you're still having to do pretty much

00:15:45	a lot of the same stuff that you did at the initial indoct the selection course maybe this would be a good point-ish actually if you could explain the difference between combat controllers and Joint terminal attack controllers uh and some some of those other elements out there like what what is the CCT job so yeah CCT we are basically our our primary Mission set is air traffic control we do it in an austere uh environment so that that's our bread and butter we also do uh you know we're surveyors dirt Landing strips

00:16:21	um uh jump uh Drop Zones uh helicopter landing zones and you know Florida refueling points um but along the way uh we were asked back when I came through about 10 of the floors was jtac qualified and a lot of it was you know hey you're really you sound really great on the mic um you can control aircraft really well do you want to try this and that's kind of how I got started in the whole jtac world uh so for us jtac is an additional certification you know combat controllers by Nature are all not joint terminal attack

00:17:00	controllers but you know we're flexible and 911 is kind of what led us to really hone our skills as far as joint terminal attack controllers and you know now I think we're doing a little bit of downsizing on that but you know we also have uh attack peas um and that's a whole separate career field which you know we kind of brought a few of them into the uh Special Operations community and so I think it's about 10 of their force is the soft tacp but a lot of what they do is you know the big army um they do closer support for uh

00:17:42	battalions you know the the big maneuver elements they do a lot of the air tasking orders allocating assets to the guys that are downrange um in their you know air spaces um uh so they deal a lot more with the whole conventional process uh versus us you know we get our own designated airspace they send us our aircraft and we're just responsible for that attack B send them to us so I mean those guys go out as well and you know they they control our traffic but they are the subject matter experts at the entire

00:18:18	jtech process uh we are experts in it but we do it in a more unconventional role yes let me uh give a quick shout out to the sponsors of this podcast um tonight we have a Groove life groovelife.com uh if you go and check them out they make uh wallets and belts and stuff like that and I'm wearing one of them today don't worry this isn't going anywhere that it can't be on YouTube uh wait is this going to devolve into no no no it's not gonna devolve we can't show that stuff on YouTube but I'm wearing one of these right now I hope

00:18:52	you guys will go and check them out uh they make a lot of nice belts you want to show off that wallet oh yeah real quick Dave uh it's groovelife.com teamhouse and you can use the promo code uh Team house to get uh 20 off your order so that's groovelife.com teamhouse and use the promo code uh Team house to get 20 off and if you like front pocket wallets uh you know for cards uh with a little money clip and stuff like they have these really nice wallets in addition and uh like check out their belts though because they have a lot of

00:19:22	really cool yeah they do some of them are a back order but they have a lot of cool Marvel stuff they have a lot of cool uh yeah they make all they make watch bands and rings too it's a great website yeah life.com and our second sponsor for tonight's show is battling blades I know we've shown off uh this uh sword before but yes we also got these cool dice yes so for any of you tabletop Gamers out there like uh Jack and I they have amazing uh swords uh axes hatchets knives any like anything you're looking

00:20:27	remember you know like one thing like so I was in regular Battalion in the late 90s and we had attack p that was there you know that was assigned to us that was always there and then the ccts if we were doing a like an Airfield seizure you know uh for training or something like that that's when the ccts would show up on their badass little mini bikes and things like that and I don't know how it was when you were there Jack if if the CT ccts were more attached to you at that point I remember we had like

00:21:00	every I mean I remember jtax I remember attack Peas I remember ccts I mean probably just everyone was so busy it probably just depended yeah deployment to the point but the thing that really separates the CCT is that is that in addition to the close air support you guys also bring that that Airhead responsibility where like you said surveying an Airfield bringing like being an air traffic controller when there's no Tower when there's no radar right but you've but you're bringing in ground troops and you're bringing in

00:21:33	support to further paint the picture a little bit like when ranger battalion jumps into some remote Airfield somewhere there's a guy like ish sitting there with his rucksack with like a radio bike in each hand like actually acting as the air traffic control tower for all of these c-17s and c-130s were coming in and to land I mean it's amazing yeah yeah and I think you know I think that's really where we made our uh money right there you know where we kind of established a lot of our credibility is

00:22:00	we you know the way I describe it to kids is like man we do anything air to ground or ground to air you know we we have that capability you know and then on top of it we can also shoot we you know we can hang with you guys because you guys bring a very unique special skill set to it we're very adaptable and I you know I guess that's uh the soft community in general I think that's what makes us pretty special is one of the things I've always been amazed about about cct's jtax tacpees is when when they're

00:22:34	like when the fight is really heavy and and it's just like the world is coming down on you and you hear Squad leaders and team leaders on the radio like yeah you know you know contact left you know blah blah the the CCT guys will sit there with like three different three different mics or two different mics and just be calm as you know like cool as a cucumber is that something that like how does it happen is it is is it is it like is that selected for do guys who just cannot maintain their sense of

00:23:13	like you know being is it something you've learned like how does that happen no so you know my entire career I've kind of had to learn things on the Fly um so I was taught a certain way um and back then it was a lot of static op cast you know and then you know that's all I knew how to do it 911 kicks off and so now I'm with the teams and I'm shooting moving you know I'm in a Humvee I'm walking around you know we're in a gunfight you know we're no longer static and I'll tell you what my first gunfight

00:23:51	I was like a chicken with my head cut off man I was all over the place and uh you know my team Sergeant he was a third group guy at the time I mean he reaches over grabs my shoulder he looks me Square in the eye you know and he was cool calm and collect and he's like ish calm down in the middle of a gunfight you know and I was like oh [ __ ] okay yeah I got it you know so you know I kind of turned everything else off and I started focusing on what I needed to do and you know uh that deployment taught

00:24:23	me a lot and I'm like man we have to change the way we train our guys you know so when we came back we started uh implementing you know now so now I'm kind of getting more as you know as the seasoned guy and uh we started coming back and saying hey we need to adjust our entire mindset our entire uh way of training we've really got to set our guys up for success you know and uh I took over the fire shop uh shortly after in my career and I started training guys and I remember you know when I first started you know it's

00:24:59	like we had guys that would just stand up you know bullets flying and whatnot and that's the way we trained we never were taught to move so I started taking chunks of rock and you know I throw it at the guys and you know they're like hey what are you doing I'm like hey man that's that's a that's a bullet coming at you you got to take cover so it's like I started chunking bigger rocks at them if they didn't get it and they learned pretty quick you know and it eventually got to the point where you

00:25:26	know I would take a guy and and this is through you know baby step process towards the end of it I'm sitting there yelling in his face I'm shooting right by his head you know I'm I'm asking him questions I'm throwing I'm trying to throw him off his game and he's taking cover now he's returning fire he's still talking to the aircraft he's got multiple radios going on at the same time and by the time I was done with the guy I he was literally cool comic collected and it didn't matter what was going on

00:25:57	he did everything the way he was supposed to direct their return fire uh stay calm and also return fire and at the same time able to multitask and you know control three or four radios at the same time so it's incred I mean really if if you're one of the people responsible for that like it really is incredible because a fire fight as everybody you know anybody who's been a one is is pure chaos to begin with and for somebody calling in air assets that are moving generally super fast at a specific

00:26:36	vector and to have a general lay of the land but it's not like you're in a talk it's not like you're in a fixed position where you can say you look at a map and go here's the enemy here or I got like everything is happening so fast and I've always been so impressed by those guys that could just keep their cool in those time and and you know pilots pilots are always like even if they're not from the south they talk like they're from the south Roger you know you know what I mean it's like they always have that language kind of you

00:27:09	know they're not excited like they're professionals they're you know keeping control and to have somebody to be able to respond to that when everybody else is yelling and everything is just incredible to me yeah oh man I'll tell you something real quick like uh one of my counterparts is you know I won't say exact same but as you know his name is Brock um so in O3 I relieved him out at uh oh zero three anyway all the timelines kind of blend together but he was out at Camp Tillman at the time and I you know we

00:27:41	were talking about certain things and you know he came out and he's like man you know I was in this gun fight and I was so calm you know it's like the guy didn't believe that I was in a gunfight you know and so I took a break and I keep the mic up next to the 50 count you know and you know he's like oh okay you guys are in a gunfight it's like yeah man you know so it's like uh a lot of times these guys are so calm that it's almost hard to believe that they're in a gunfight you know yeah and it's amazing

00:28:13	because you know we talk about like you know in combat Target identification things like that and and reacting responsibly or you know reacting in a responsive fashion in in a you know nebulous environment you can kill Anissa you kill a civilian you you know like things can happen because you're just like on the go and and whatnot and you're making split sex uh Split Second decisions and for somebody like with the power of a CCT that has way bigger ramifications to to not maintain that calm and tune you know to

00:28:53	just pull that trigger before you know where the target is and and identify it right yeah I mean battle tracking is huge um obviously you know like I work hand in hand with the captain uh the team leader you know it's like you know if I screw up he's going to jail you know and I'm not gonna let him go to jail um and none of our guys want that so I mean we're constantly on it head on a swivel uh we know where guys are at all the time uh for me I'm not dropping them unless I know for a fact that that is

00:29:30	the enemy and you know through either uh aircraft identification uh visual confirmation or you know I even take it as far as having my grits checked by either one party or a second party you know because that is the last thing I want to do but I mean and it's chaotic you know it is extremely chaotic but you know I mean it you know I got 10 aircraft in the set 10 sets of aircraft in the sack you know each one to fly to two um I got artillery going uh I'm tracking the guys that are shooting and moving

00:30:05	I'm talking to the captain and I'm relaying information to the uh soda if you know it's it's it's insane what goes on and for some reason it's like you know we're all trained to track all this I mean heck now I I you know I can't tell you what I did yesterday or an hour but it's like you know as soon as the gun fighting starts like as soon as the stress levels up like it's just something snaps you know and a lot of it goes back down to how you train um and obviously experience it's incredible to me I mean I have the

00:30:41	uh for you know you talk you talk about going to summer school you know and and whatnot but obviously you were a very bright guy because that's not a job or even air traffic control that's not a job that you most people even smart people can do effectively oh yeah man it it like you really have to think in a 3D realm like you know uh it's funny I actually took a a test um a while back you know it was the IQ test and my results were is that you know my my IQ was a little bit of above average but what really set me apart is my

00:31:27	ability and you know and I don't know if it's everybody and I don't know if everybody's had these tests and I wish they would administer to all of them but my uh 3D perception was through the roof and it just so happened that you know I have to be able to visualize things in a 3D World especially dealing with air traffic control artillery bombs coming you know like it got to the point throughout my career is I could point in the direction where there was an aircraft coming it's like I could almost

00:31:59	visualize the bombs flying through the air I could visualize that aircraft flying through the air I could visualize where the enemy was I could visualize where my team was at all times you know um it's it's a really surreal feeling um but yeah you know I I consider myself a knuckle dragger but I think you know having that ability is what you you know kind of made me successful and you know I I think all of us in the soft Community have you know something of that nature otherwise I you know honestly I don't think we would be as

00:32:34	successful as we are within these soft Realms because you really it doesn't matter what job you're doing you have to be able to multitask you have to be able to take on all these things and you know in a gunfight in life and death situations right yeah that's that's what sets it apart ish can uh you take us through this deployment uh you said 2009 and 2010 you had a pretty eventful one yeah um you know 2009 uh I taken a little break for for well not necessarily break it's just you know I hadn't deployed for a couple years so

00:33:11	uh in 2009 or prior to 2009 I was like I better get a good deployment I want to go to the hottest place I want to go to you know I I miss the action so uh my uh senior enlisted leader United You Know Chief masterton at the time um he's like yeah I'll send you wherever you want to go and you know I was like all right just I don't care where I go just send me to the hottest place and you know my buddy had gotten blown up a month before so I got recalled so hey get ready to go all my bags were packed

00:33:45	um luckily he didn't sustain uh major injuries uh he had a nice TBI uh Captain John Tinsley was killed though on that uh deployment they hit an IED um everybody else was wounded um not severely but Tinsley unfortunately took the brunt of it and uh so I deployed and I mean you know as soon as I got there I got a month orientation and it was totally on um you know I was kind of developing courses of action as to how to get rid of uh Tinsley's truck which was still up on the hill and obviously the Rules of Engagement

00:34:24	were a hell of a lot different you know back then um especially during that time where we moved kind of towards the peacekeeping you know type of mission so so we went up there and our plan was to see for it and try to get rid of it because it was kind of a trophy for the Taliban at the time you know and so we went up there and uh I mean the locals stopped us or like hey they got this place completely lined with IEDs like you guys shouldn't go up there and went yeah okay we we got it thank you we

00:34:59	kind of assumed it uh we were grateful for the warning you know so uh immediately as soon as we were moving up we found you know eight nine IEDs right off the bat so you know we're just sitting there marking them um too many to take care of right at that instant um my team had half my team had cleared the village behind us uh half my team was mounted um you know pulling security me the the Bravo and the Charlie decided to push forward looking for more IDs you know we're not wasting time but we need to find these create a path

00:35:33	forward to Tinsley's truck and as we were going along I mean we found number 10 we found number 11 we found number 12 we found number three I mean it was the whole place was a Minefield you know I I mean they they knew we were going to come back for that truck eventually um so my captain calls me up and he's like he's looking for me you know and he wants me back where he's at near the village and I'm like Hey sir I got a vantage point of the entire terrain I can see everything I can do my job from

00:36:04	anywhere you know all and he's like all right cool and as soon as I turned around man this uh IED just blew up in front of us and you know I I like I thought we were all hit you know I first thing I I thought I was dead you know I thought my guys were dead I mean it was about 15 to 20 feet in front of us and I mean it was just black soot and everything you know and uh really it was kind of time stood still at that moment and uh so you know after the pucker Factor wears off you know it's like you start

00:36:38	realizing oh [ __ ] I'm alive you know you start checking the junk start checking everything else making sure everything is still in place you know checking on your buddies and you know I'm you know at that point I'm getting lit up and I'm not you know I'm still in shock you know but I'm starting to realize like oh [ __ ] I'm out in the open um it's only a matter of time before I get hit you know so I you know diving for cover and uh calling in artillery and starting to try to get the uh advantage on them you know it

00:37:11	um they had us that the rights from that Hill uh but thank God that they always shoot from the hip like I'm like that is the only thing that saved Our Lives is I mean had they actually taken the time to aim like I mean we would have been gone I wouldn't be here today you know neither would they um but yeah I mean it you know obviously we got the advantage I started dropping artillery we ended up getting 64 started tracking dudes eight tens came along um you know started uh they ended up taking cover they they took cover in a

00:37:48	in a uh Cave and the Apaches uh which were the uh what were they the uh all right not Danish anyway one of those countries probably the Dutch it uh yeah the Dutch started calling it calling it in helping me identify it you know they started marking for the a10s and man the A-10 started dropping bombs on it they collapsed the entire cave complex there's about 32 guys in there we started mowing down all the little uh the uh drainage canals that they used for cover and I mean it was just game on you know the rest of the crew started uh

00:38:27	coming up next to us um clearing as the eye you know clearing up next up to our position we're completely out of ammo you know um but we we got the advantage and we continue to press forward uh past hour the edge of our white space so to speak so you know we kind of gained ground on that mission and I mean it was just one thing after the other and uh I mean you know it it happened so slowly but at the same time it was like it was like an eternity you know I'm sure you guys can attest to that it's like

00:39:01	it's crazy how fast it happens but it's also crazy how slow it feels you know and um 18 hours later or 16 hours later we're done with a gun fight you know heading back home and I mean that's how my deployment to Firebase Cobra started you know and I mean after that it was just gunfight after gunfight we got at least one good gunfight a week um you know I think it was like 16 major gun fights um and I can't remember how many total but it was it it was the hottest place on the planet at the time um we lost uh one guy a week if not two

00:39:46	on certain you know weeks and you know I'm talking about Kia we're not talking about just wounded you know wounded I couldn't even tell you how many we actually took but uh so I did nine months at that location and you know okay and on top of it I broke both my arms and my wrist on that initial contact you know it was when when I was getting shot at I took a dive and I ended up blocking my fall like I'm literally flying Hollywood style through the air you know and I blocked my fall with my hands and uh so

00:40:24	I ended up with two broken arms and then later on the next year I ended up with a broken ankle and I haven't you know I still have no idea how the heck I managed it so so I just want to slow down for a second or you're saying that in the initial Salvo or during that you broke your arms and then did you continue to operate radios and call in air support with broken arm with two broken arms oh man yeah I mean you know the adrenaline you know adrenaline is kicking and I remember as soon as I hit the ground I

00:41:05	was like man this is I hit pretty hard you know and you're not really thinking about it you know and but I felt that burn I mean it was just an intense burn in my right elbow what happened was you know the ulna and the radio uh bones ended up crushing into the uh what is it the humorous or whatever humorous yeah so it it crushed them together you know and so I felt the burn immediately and uh I remember it hurting picking up my gun when I got into position I started returning fire uh my left hand hurt but

00:41:42	not quite as much as the right so you know I really didn't think twice about it and we kept fighting calling it you know I kept calling in cast and all that and you know I remember when 16 hours later when we finally it's like hey let's get out of here let's return to base because we're out of ammo and by the way we're freaking tired and the fighting's done right uh the adrenaline finally wore out and I couldn't even pick up my rifle and I was like man this hurts you know and uh I just wrapped it with an Ace bandage

00:42:15	and it's just we kept going you know take a little bit of Motrin right uh vitamin M that's right that's right that is crazy-ish I it it just is baffling to the imagination that you had two broken arms and a broken wrist and you are you're you're you're raising these might you're you're you're calling an error you're fighting you're operating your rifle it's just so bizarre and an amazing um and I know that you're like oh you know I like I don't know I don't think my you know I don't think much about my Awards but

00:43:02	when I hear other people's Awards is sort of I always think back to that Groucho Marx uh comment that I would never be a member of a club that would have me as a member that you never think of yourself as the guy was this the the action that you were awarded a silver star for yeah it was the it was that gunfight in particular yeah I I wonder why yeah I mean dude honestly to me it you know I I look at these things and it's like man it was you know another day it's uh you know what we trained for

00:43:36	it's you know it doesn't feel as significant yeah right I mean even now I look at it and it's like man I was doing my job but you know I I look at some of the guys that I've trained you know I look at uh my buddies that I know and it's like you know Air Force Cross recipients you know and I'm like man that is wow you know I'm like at all I'm like God I wish I would have had a mission like that you know and then I look at other Silver Star recipients and I'm like dude his [ __ ] is way better than mine I'm like

00:44:10	wow you know and it's it to me it's business as usual it's like yeah so I did this so you know I got in a gunfight yeah they shot at us we shot back we won I'm like I I broke both my arms and continued to operate for 16 hours you know that that it was just it was just the job you know yeah I might I'm like a teacher I'm a hero well just like teachers and so that uh it sounds like that deployment was pretty intense I mean how did how did things you know go on as you kind of got deeper into that what did you say it was

00:44:42	nine months that you were over there oh man it was uh it was one thing after the other you know and uh we kept on uh continuing our fights continuing to push on um there was uh uh a few other incidents that occurred you know uh as they do you may you may have heard about the minibus incident uh where mccrystal apologized and uh well who was who was the president of them Obama I think everybody came out and apologized and it's like no they were bad guys you know we killed bad guys but because the Third vehicle was carrying

00:45:22	not bad guys let's just put it that way um you know they kind of started uh uh you know putting the kibosh on us they kind of started uh restricting the amount of ordinance that we could drop you know the basically our freedom of movement you know I mean but we've still gotten we got a lot of gunfights you know and um halfway through it uh I was my team was replaced by a first group team you know and don't get me wrong that seventh group team was amazing I mean all these guys are professionals they were they were awesome the entire

00:46:00	uh however many gunfights we were in the first group came first group came in and uh you know it started up again I mean we were those those guys having no experience were quick to learn um a lot of uh firefights involving you know we're chasing after them they're coming after us it's like we're flanking them they're trying to flank us and I mean the whole deployment it was you know just intermittent gun battles every single you know couple days at a minimum once a week for the entire nine months I

00:46:39	mean it's just uh it was like the Wild Wild West yeah and the Taliban you know you talk about the minibus uh thing and I I don't remember that but one thing that I do know is the Taliban was great at PR and and they understood they understood how our government would respond uh any time they waged a PR campaign and said that you know Innocents were killed and and unfortunately sometimes Innocents were killed but a lot of times it was just a taliban-led effort where they could say American forces just came in and did

00:47:14	this thing and then whomever was the president or whatever would like stop they would just stop dead you know the the action is on and then it would inhibit everybody's ability to fight oh yeah I mean they know they know you know even when they're moving you know they'll they'll position women they'll position kids they'll ride with women and kids you know and so if something does happen if they do get hit it's like it's it's it it's a uh political campaign that they run right and they know it's gonna make headlines and you

00:47:49	know the American population is oblivious to it they have no concept of what's going on and you know they buy into it all the time our politicians um don't have a nut sack for lack of a better word you know to kind of come out and say hey This Is How They Roll these are their tactics right techniques and procedures and so a lot of times it seemed as though our media would uncritically just accept accept their claims and report it as fact right that there was no actual investigation into it um it was the same thing that we talked

00:48:20	about with the Marine Raiders right or or the MARSOC and it almost got them disbanded but in that case it was the military itself that was right right um so you know you going back to the to the first firefight did you guys have air on station at the time or did you have to wait for it no uh I I try to coordinate rotary Wing beforehand you know with it I always do I always have them uh come in about you know a couple of hours after we've departed kind of to keep that element of surprise uh but we we had none at the time

00:48:59	um you know we went in there uh totally non-ex not expecting a gunfight you know expecting IEDs yeah but with not expect a gunfight uh but man you know that there was you know uh cast flying overhead just different regions uh but the heroes were the first to respond um we had organic artillery at our Firebase and that was kind of at their limit you know yeah anything outside of that would have required a wraparound or something but uh no uh the the Dutch uh responded immediately uh and then you know again I

00:49:35	don't you know at the time I don't know I don't have a sense of time but um the A10 showed up um and then it was just rocking and rolling from there so this is something I don't think we've ever talked about on our show can you tell people sort of the difference between like what fixed Wing is what rotary Wing is and then what dedicated assets are versus like being out there and having and waiting on assets yeah so uh fixedling is you know any kind of uh closer support flap uh platform that uh you know like an

00:50:13	airplane type you know like uh a fixed Wing is just you know bombers uh a10s um gunships um uh fighter jets you know and then the rotary ring is anything helicopter or anything with rotors um then you have cast you have uh on-call cast which basically if you get in the predicament if you you know make contact either you can prepare uh and have them ready to send you something or start looking for any kind of error assets any close air support assets that are within your area that could make it to you

00:50:54	um and then you that's all on call um so basically you have to get in that situation and then you you know declare troops in contact and they'll send you those error assets wherever they can pull them from um and then you have your uh your planned error assets so you know you're it I send up those requests and they're already pre-coordinated um I can set up either from the time I depart my Firebase or I can say hey we plan to be at this position at you know whatever time I need to show up at this

00:51:29	time and you know a lot of times you don't want to like me myself I didn't want a pre-plane cast because then that steals uh air support from someone else but you always have some sort of asset flying around in the event that you know something does happen um so then it becomes on call so when I request you know at that particular situation um we got in a gunfight I requested air assets they pushed whatever was available to me um and then you know behind the scenes you have to attack PS working additional

00:52:03	assets like okay let's start launching you know whoever's on on alert uh let's start pulling these assets in case the situation develops even more which you know in our situation it did sure um so they're constantly feeding me guys without me having to call them you know and then once we're done once you know the fighting's over it's like okay uh you know we're constantly sending the information back and it's like hey uh we haven't taken fire in so long or whatever the case is uh we're ending the

00:52:37	troops in contact right now um so then they start tapering back on those error assets and they either send them back where they are supposed to be or send them back to whoever originally requested them but that's the primary difference and were you ever because I think one of the challenges that people understand sometimes is a you know when you're talking about like tier one assets you know that and they have this dedicated error when you're out there and you don't have like dedicated have you ever

00:53:10	been in situations where because you had multiple troops in contact or this or the area of operations was very hot that it was challenging to get error you know I I've never been in that situation honestly um I think our attack beat Brethren do an amazing job getting air assets overhead you know I think uh the only time I've ever uh been limited by uh aircraft is during inclement weather um obviously the aircraft can't take off you know uh aircraft can't you know see you on the ground or whatever and you

00:53:51	know I have dropped through the through weather but you can't take off and you can't land and you know wherever they're taken off from really that's my only limiting factor other than that you know our our Brethren um I mean they do their job and they do it extremely well um you know because they know it's life and death and then you know next deployment it could be them you know um so yeah I've never been faced with that situation particularly so your uh your next appointment was 2011 you said that

00:54:24	was your last one and also a little dicey yeah so uh my that deployment ended in 2000 uh June of 2010 and you know I I mean I wanted to go back uh shortly thereafter so um I came home rested for a little bit refitted um and I went back in January of 2011 and uh this time was out by uh Taryn cow so yeah I only did two missions um and you know the the first mission was two weeks after arriving in country and man that was a week-long gun fight as soon as we got it you know in the bad guy territory

00:55:09	spotted a couple guys laying IEDs uh we chased them down tried to shoot them you know obviously we didn't catch them found the IED kind of started following them in the direction that they were driving end up in the cemetery and I mean we just fought It Out close L Ambush you know and uh yeah it was fun you know it this is what my uh what is a test deployment so it was like I mean at that point it just starts getting fun after a while you know it's still scary as [ __ ] don't get me wrong but it you know it's like you find a lot of

00:55:51	uh enjoyment in it you know and uh we ended up holding up at uh at our strong point area you know fighting through a cemetery dropping bombs and I mean it was having to call guys out another team to come out and draw essentially draw fire so that we can get out of there you know and hopefully survive you know um but yeah and then two weeks later we turned around and you know they're like hey we need you guys to go back into the same area so you know two weeks later we turn around and you know when

00:56:26	we went in through a different uh Direction you know and I mean it was it turned out to be a 21 day running gun battle like literally a running gun battle and you know it's it's like you planned for something but I don't think I've ever executed a plan and it go according to plan my entire career it's like [ __ ] changes all the time right is so in this 21 day running gun battle were you guys I mean obviously you guys had to get resupplyed like uh you run out of ammo after you know an hour um what like how how does this work for

00:57:06	you guys oh so man we were resupplied uh three different times in those 21 days so obviously our our plan went to crap so I you know we we're supposed to have two elements one on the east side one on the west side west side we're supposed to you know move together and push all the forces out you know South and I mean we started getting blown up uh we started taking fire like you know it we never really got to even begin to execute the plan as as we were planning it um so we decided the strong point of

00:57:48	building and I mean you know uh what was it three days into it we ran we ran out of grenades we you know we were in a grenade War like a trench war yeah uh it was it was raining it was freezing it was sleeting you know we're fighting in the mud we're fighting in trenches we're dropping bombs through the weather and I mean if if you know for people who don't know what dropping bombs through the weather is the aircraft can't see you on the ground they can't see the target they can't see where you're at

00:58:19	um they're basically dropping on the grid coordinates and trusting you you know and I'm trusting them at the same time um so we're literally you know literally fighting and seeing the whites of their eyes and we run out of ammo um as soon as it clears up you know we get a couple of uh c-130s they're flying low to the Earth and they're literally as soon as they get over where I want them to drop they speed line it up and everything just comes down in four parachutes four different palettes um if you don't know what the size of a

00:59:00	pallet is it's I mean I what is it roughly a five by five you know cubed uh and it's all full of ammunition yeah so four different palettes three different resupplies that's a whole lot of ammo throughout the whole process so I mean it was so they were they so for people just to give people an image so these c-130s which are propeller airplanes are flying very close to the ground and then when they get ready to drop their air bundle they basically go oh as straight up as they can so that those bundles essentially drop straight

00:59:41	down because they can't control them once they leave the aircraft those shoes can get caught by the wind like they can go anywhere but they're trying to set them straight down to you guys so you don't have to like fight your way to your ammunition absolutely you know uh typically you know we drop them at about you know five to six hundred feet above ground level well the problem with that is that you know the wind could carry them off uh they're not always going to land within close proximity and in situations like that you

01:00:16	literally want them to drop on a dime so as they're coming in low and fast you know I'm telling them exactly where to drop it and as soon as they get over that position they're beelining it up as straight as they can so that it drops in that exact position and you know me and my team don't have to go out there and put ourselves at risk in you know pulling these bundles up you know it's not like we have equipment to pull them out you know it's like a suit wherever they land is where we're on packaging

01:00:49	them and we're taking them into our strong point uh and then you know rearming ourselves that's so crazy and how did they do how did those C-130 Pilots do oh they were on it I mean spot on every single one of the guys every single resupply was literally spot on exactly where I wanted it it that's incredible how did that mission uh go on as you get can I I mean we're talking about what three weeks here uh what was that like I mean as it drags on longer and longer I mean imagine the guys aren't sleeping very

01:01:24	well everyone's strung out you know as time goes on well you know uh so absolutely that is the case you know we we started out really good but our guys I mean you know our dudes are awesome they're amazing um we have a tendency to fight a hell of a lot longer but the our partner Force however you know a lot of times they can't handle the duration um so as we're fighting um you know we took a lot of casualties right off the get-go um we took casualties not even having made it to our objective and so

01:02:11	you know I I can't give you an accurate count of how many of our partner Force we lost you know we we went in with about 90 guys um I say all in all Kia and wounded we lost about 30 um in the first weeks you know we possibly the second week you know my my numbers are a little bit uh my memory is a little bit sketched when it comes to all those numbers but um we had IEDs along the way um and we would always go and tend to the wounded we would always drag the wounded out um so as we're going through

01:02:50	our guys obviously were tired you know were were but we're holding it together uh but as we go along our partner Force isn't really handling it quite as well so they're they're willing to fight is kind of diminishing um there's a few of them that continue to fight but the vast majority do not a lot of them are scared because they've lost a lot of the counter counterparts um I mean how about uh about halfway through it we even had uh our guys tried to shoot uh it was myself uh the second jtac uh

01:03:31	and our two Medics we were X filling one of our Medics because he was actually pretty close to one of the IEDs and he got a pretty bad concussion so um it was kind of a a green on Blue in hindsight I think they were trying to get rid of us so that they could go home you know and this is all completely after the fact and it's like man that was uh kind of odd because I kind of alerted everybody it's like hey there's a helicopter coming uh we need to get this guy out uh it will be you know and we were all

01:04:05	there I'm like we're all gonna go outside our strong point but it still happened you know and then uh fast forward as the days go by I mean it got to the point where we were in a Mexican standoff um it was them pointing guns at us and our guys were pretty calm you know we there was no guns pointed at uh from our end there was no guns pointing at our partner Force but you know me and uh the team Sergeant were up on the hill pulling OverWatch and uh I looked over and I saw our uh counterparts Commander

01:04:46	pointing an AK my commander you know my alpha or team captain and so I'm like [ __ ] you know so I put my scope on the partner forces head and I radio down and I'm like hey you know bro like I have him just say the word you know and our captain was like nobody do [ __ ] nobody make a move and he defused the situation you know which was which was awesome and you know I came down off the hill and I'm like man we got to get rid of these guys like we need to replace them so we uh you know I requested uh 47 to come in

01:05:28	get that partner Force out and send us fresh uh fresh guys so you know it happened that night but I mean it was just yeah the fighting was so intense and it was just so long that our guys were our guys did amazing you know it was probably one of the one of the best teams I've ever worked with you know they were professional um they did their job I mean it was from Communications to I mean execution to to it it worked like magic it was amazing everything that you know that I've ever wanted and like hey keep me abreast of

01:06:09	the situation it happened uh but unfortunately our partner force was not on the same playing field that we were in and you know they they were the biggest um I guess slim fact you know in in the whole situation you know they were the biggest uh they just didn't want to play ball right and but the you know the entire 21 days was kind of like that and you know yeah we didn't sleep no you know I think I slept the least just because I'm constantly you know calling in air I'm constantly talking aircraft

01:06:45	uh my check cat the alternate jtac helped me out a lot but you know at the end of the day it's like I kind of felt like it was my responsibility so you know I took on probably more than I should have but you know it was it was just an amazing time you know it was it was an amazing time the entire process you know it's interesting because I I think there's really a fascinating point because you say it was an amazing time and you say it was fun and I totally understand that and maybe a lot of our civilian viewers and

01:07:17	listeners don't understand that can can you can you talk about it that experience why is that even though you are fighting for your life you're sleep deprived you know you're you're running on the Ragged Edge a Razor's Edge really why is that fun and and why is that you know yeah it's it's an interesting thing because I don't think obviously you guys understand you know uh our military brothers who have been in gunfights who have been you know downrange they completely understand but you know the civilian population I think they

01:08:00	have a really hard time you know understanding that uh it's not gunfights to me um you know they're incredibly fun they're incredibly scary um I mean it's just think about every single emotion you've ever had in your entire life and combine it you know take the greatest take the happiest take you know you're fighting for your life and it's every single emotion mixed into one you know it's like you know you're you're doing something fun you're doing something exciting you're doing something that could possibly kill you

01:08:49	you know and and the adrenaline I mean how do I describe it it's a every single emotion rolled into one and it's fun and it's scary but it's like you know once you return to the civilian World once you you try to talk to anybody they can't fathom it because you know it's it's it's it's truly being alive it's understanding death it's understanding life it's having a purpose for life you know and going through those situations it's like you know having a complete understanding of what living and life is how precious life is

01:09:39	and how quickly it can be taken away from you you know it's just it's everything rolled up into one it's like the Ultimate Experience you know it's interesting because I just got the image of um sort of a civilian counterpart in a way and maybe this will make sense to you uh and and Jack uh and our other like veteran listeners is that if you think of a roller coaster right there are people that get forced to go under Roller Coaster by people who are like let's go and they don't want it and then

01:10:13	those and and right and then there are people who go on roller coasters and enjoy them but are like okay that was really scary I don't think I'm gonna go again or I'll go again but I'm really scared and then there are people that at the very top will raise their hands right and then and then go down it's like [ __ ] yeah like yeah I'm terrified but like this is it and yeah and that's sort of the people who raise their hands and keep on doing it again are it that's the civilian equivalent in a way to the

01:10:42	people and not just soft but even conventional the conventional people who go back over they're like I'm gonna go back I'm gonna go back right it's like this is what it is this is what life is about it's like pushing that edge and feeling that fear and coming through the other side I I know that was uh that was your last deployment issue but there's actually another one I wanted to ask you about um that's a little a little interesting um it was about the your deployment to Colombia and that's uh obviously a

01:11:14	totally different theater totally different experience than Afghanistan I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what that was like yeah um you know that was a time where I I decided uh I I wanted to take a break from underflowing I wanted to take a break from basically everything you know because by that point I was pretty uh I was smoked I had broken my back um but you know uh my marriage was on the Rocks it's like like I I just wanted a break but it just never happened you know and

01:11:46	um this opportunity came down well it wasn't really much of an opportunity but I got you know I was chosen because of my Spanish my Spanish abilities and so I was sent down to South America and you know obviously the the details of the job I really can't go into specifics um but you know going down to South America obviously coming from nothing but desert deployments um was a completely different world and uh I didn't get to see the fun parts of Colombia you know I always hear people talking about Colombia and it's like

01:12:29	yeah it was a blast right and you know when they talked to me like oh my God that's so awesome I'm like no dude I'm like my experience you're like I wasn't Secret Service yeah yeah yeah we can didn't get invited to those parties yeah I didn't go to those parties yeah um you know I I spent my entire month in the jungle and uh I I ended up losing 25 pounds um and it was I was literally wet I'm talking shower just got out of the shower type wet right but I was also literally in the middle of a triple

01:13:14	canopy jungle and we were looking for bad guys and there was a possibility of a gunfight and obviously you know the the I you know I could tell you that I never got into a gunfight in the jungle but just having had to live there I mean you know I started uh and let me let me preface it was with with it that environment was probably one of the greatest experiences of My Life um simply because you know you can imagine a jungle but I'm talking this is Triple Canopy I'm talking as soon as it starts getting dark you're

01:13:54	stopping because as soon as it's dark you're screwed you can't see like anything in front of your face even with nvg right you're not seeing anything yeah because there's no ambient light coming down no ambient light it is just pitch black yep you know and and uh like you can't fathom this you can't even imagine this unless you've actually been there and you know it is so freaking loud it is I mean it is loud at night it is loud during the day it is deafening how loud it is and you know to it to me I

01:14:33	feel like you know most people will never get to see this part of the Jungle we'll never get to experience this part you know but uh for me having lived there for a month it's like wow it is an amazing experience having you know had to learn how to survive Having learned that you know you have to drink at every especially not being acclimated you get a drink as much as you can you got to stay hydrated you know my partner force that we were with they're like hey you have to stop drinking and I'm like

01:15:07	bro you know in Spanish I'm like bro you don't understand if I stop drinking I'm dead if I stop sweating I'm dead you know and they they couldn't understand that concept but you know uh above all else like it made me think about the guys in Vietnam you know the guys that have actually had to fight wars in the jungle type of environment and I was like I was taken back I'm like man okay so I'm just walking through I've never made contact you know I I didn't make contact the entire time but I'm like I'm sucking this bad right

01:15:50	now and imagine being in Vietnam yeah and imagine being in the same type of conditions and now I have to fight for my life right I mean it was just it was amazing I mean it gave me a whole different perspective yeah yeah moving to contact in that environment not with just the environmental factors or of the underbrush and overgrowth like all that but just the physical toll it takes on your body yeah yeah having to deal with trench foot having to deal with you know just completely soaking wet the entire time

01:16:25	you know it's it's just it was taken back yeah no it's you know it it's it's interesting because we we've we're fortunate we get a number of guys you know both from you know the South African cop or for the African conflicts and from Vietnam on her show but there's really no way to appreciate yeah what they went through because it was in a completely like when they tell us stories I Know Jack and I are both like we're like Afghanistan and Iraq were one thing but but moving through Vietnam like never knowing

01:17:07	you can't see what's going on you're like you don't know where things are happening and then the environmental factors are another thing that are just like beating those guys to hell oh yeah yeah absolutely you know like um uh I've had a a lot of friends like you know for example L.D Cox he was a survivor of the USS Indianapolis you know it's the guys who's you know both got sunk and like literally they were getting eaten by sharks um uh Colonel Cole he was Doolittle's uh co-pilot you know they're the guys who

01:17:44	dropped the atomic bomb you know like uh you know and so on and so forth like I've had a lot of Vietnam guys and you know I meet them um most have unfortunately passed you know both LD Cox and Nicole have passed away but you know I meet these guys and they're like man you guys had it hard I'm like what are you talking about you know in in my mind right right I'm like they think that we had it so hard and I'm like bro like if we have all this technology we have all these warmies for one we have all this stuff

01:18:21	to make our lives a hell of a lot more comfortable even during war I'm like you guys like just sucked it up yeah you know you guys were the greatest Generation you guys fought in Vietnam you guys fought in the Korean War you know it but they think that we had it hard right I'm like you know I'm like no like you dudes had a heart right yeah we have not experienced things like the Baton death Marsh the Frozen chosen you know a lot of the events like in Vietnam you know the the 10 offense you know the these

01:18:53	events I mean look we had guys go through Fallujah I was never there but we had you know Marine we had soldiers go through Fallujah like they we've had events but but there are definitely markers in our own like military history that I think modern veterans can look back on and go how the [ __ ] did they do that oh yeah ish uh this was uh you know at this point you know your career's starting to wind down you're getting closer to retirement can you tell us about you know how you retired from the Air Force

01:19:29	and and what your experience was like transitioning to civilian life yeah you know uh so I I I retired uh I was medically retired um right before covet actually I started my medboard process so um you know and at the same time you know I I'd had a uh valley fever so my lungs were pretty messed up and you know I spent three months on bed rest uh and then I started recover from that and you know then uh uh we had a baby so like I took some paternal leave and then admitted after that after I went to work

01:20:12	uh covet hit so then shortly after that they're like hey stay home um my medboard process time you know it was like okay you're you're getting medically uh retired so you know I didn't work for about the first six months but the last six months of my career but I mean it was hard you know it it's like you know going 100 miles an hour and then now all of a sudden you're you're not doing anything you know now it's uh your career is ending um I kind of had the the uh the benefit of slowing down a little bit

01:20:52	uh prior to me retiring it's actually been a few years you know and I got I got hurt pretty good in 2010 2011 got her a little bit more and then I started my surgeries in 2012 so I kind of had it uh a little bit of time to get adjusted to it but you know I don't think anything actually prepares you for uh that final day although you know it felt like Freedom you know you know I retired as an EA you know E6 e7s anybody in the military you know they they your entire career for one you can't get fired you know and if you do you're just

01:21:39	probably shipped off to somewhere else but it's like you carry a lot of weight behind your rank regardless of where you're at you know and when I found it what I found interesting was when I finally retired you know and uh becoming a civilian it's like it doesn't matter who you are who you were what rank you held what position you held you're done yeah it's all gone like all your friends uh the influence you had it none of that matters and I think that's one of the things that I had one of the hardest

01:22:18	times with you know and um it's like okay I you know I went from someone who had the ability to speak their mind and you know I had a little bit of an audience and you know I could actually influence some sort of change for the better you know to now you're like oh you're a civilian um it doesn't matter what you say what you think what you're trying to change you're a civilian you're out now you know and to me that was the biggest shock um it's like you completely lose whatever status you had in the military yeah

01:22:57	active duty overnight yeah and at the same time civilians don't care like they don't care I mean look I don't I don't know how many people have won two silver stars but I I can assure you that it's not a lot and that's not going to get you a job anywhere like civilians don't care about what you did in the military unless the qualifications meet the job they're trying to hire but everything that you did it doesn't matter that you were in a 21 day running gun battle with free combat ER you know resuppies

01:23:38	they don't care yeah absolutely so you're in this like nebulous world right so how do you transition or make a new life for yourself uh you know honestly like you know I I contemplated going in the corporate world uh I contemplating getting uh you know a desktop um but it's kind of hard because you know my entire career has never actually felt like a job um it's never felt like work like honestly I have a hard time quantifying what work really is you know um but it you know now it you know even

01:24:27	even uh my better half was like you're not gonna survive a desktop she's like you actually have to talk to people you have to cater to people you have to bend over backwards for their feelings you can't boss people around anymore you can't set realistic goals and and hold them accountable I'm like what you know so you know really I started gravitating more towards work with you know people that I know uh same people with the same background um for me it's just hard to adapt to the the regular world you know it's kind of

01:25:12	like opening up Pandora's Box like you can't close it anymore um civilians are on a completely different level if they've never been through or have experience or have an open mind to it or anything like that it's just it's extremely hard so what what have you been doing since retirement I went to work for uh uh our Schoolhouse as uh cool uh for a little bit and started training and mentoring guys for a little bit um I was let go from that job um under weird weird circumstances um basically somebody got butt hurt over

01:25:50	something that I said which had nothing to do with them but they got butt hurt anyway you know and whatever it's their problem I'm not sour about it I'm not pissed you know and I'm like whatever it it's not gonna kill me nobody's dying That's My Philosophy you know that I live by now it's not killing me nobody's dying it's not that bad you know um which I have them to thank for because now you know I'm I'm doing a security gig um which the customer wants to remain kind of a little bit Anonymous and I'm

01:26:25	making twice what the hell the other company was paying me or so I'm like thank you you know yeah I was getting ready to take leave without pay anyway so it doesn't really matter to me but um it's just Society is becoming so sensitive that it's like you know even these big badass operators are getting butt hurt over the most trivial things you know but you can't say something's [ __ ] up when it's [ __ ] up like you ought to be able to you ought to be able to point to it say that's that's messed up exactly you

01:27:00	know we grew up in the days where you know my commander had an open policy he's like hey you come in here tell me I'm [ __ ] up but if you're gonna come in here and tell me how I'm [ __ ] up is like you better have a possible solution like don't just come in here and whine tell me how to fix it you know and now nobody wants to hear that anymore um but yeah you know my new company is amazing uh they're they're all about respect they're all about treating everybody uh mutually you know with with the same respect and you know talking

01:27:33	about it they have open door policies it's it's amazing it's an amazing company you know um but yeah it's basically the security business and I'm loving it um plus you know they gave me a lot of days off and the pay is amazing and you know when I'm not working I'm a full-time dad to three little guys and they consume my time yeah which I love yeah that's awesome that's great um where can where can people find you wish if they're looking for you uh if they want to maybe hire you for a security gig or or whatever else you're
